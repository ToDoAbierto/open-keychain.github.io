title: "German Study Published: “Usage of OpenPGP on Android”"
---

As a subcontractor, Vincent Breitmoser (OpenKeychain) and Dominik Schürmann (OpenKeychain/TU Braunschweig), participated in the [Gpg4all](https://wiki.gnupg.org/Gpg4all2015) project led by [Intevation GmbH](https://intevation.de) and [g10 Code GmbH](https://g10code.com).
The project has been published as a [public tender](https://www.evergabe-online.de/tenderdetails.html?id=96237) and is funded by the German [Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)](https://www.bsi.bund.de).

One part of this project was to create a study of the current state of OpenPGP support on Android.
We defined requirements for OpenPGP implementations on mobile devices, in particular on the Android Operating System and provide an overview over currently available apps to evaluate if their functionality satisfies the requirements.
Based on this evaluation, we propose several further development opportunities based on OpenKeychain.

We are happy to announce that the results of this study have now been [published under the Creative Commons License (CC-BY-SA) on the BSI website](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Publikationen/Studien/OpenPGP/openpgpandroid.html) (German only).
