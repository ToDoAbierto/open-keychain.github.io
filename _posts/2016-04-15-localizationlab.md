Until today, translations of OpenKeychain were managed by me on Transifex.
Due to my focus on developing OpenKeychain and producing code, I wasn't able to coordinate the translation efforts in a good way or to improve the translation by myself.

Today, I am happy to announce that we now cooperate with the [Localization Lab](http://www.localizationlab.org/).
That means that we moved the coordination and management of our translations on Transifex to their [organization](https://www.transifex.com/otf/open-keychain/).
The Localization Lab is a global community of volunteer translators who support the translation and localization of Internet freedom tools, such as OpenKeychain.
They translate more than 30 tools into over 180 different languages and dialects and currently expand their translations of tools in Tagalog, Khmer, Vietnamese, Burmese, Laotian, Indonesian, Thai and Chinese (simplified and traditional scripts).
The Localization Lab community is growing and this year will be coming together for community events, translation sprints and other fun activities that will push forward the localization of these tools.
You can find out more about their efforts on [www.localizationlab.org](http://www.localizationlab.org/).
