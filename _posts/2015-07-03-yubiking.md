title: We are YubiKings!
---

OpenKeychain has been selected as one of three winners of Yubico's [YubiKing
virtual hackathon](https://www.yubico.com/yubiking/), officially crowning our
humble project as YubiKing, a title which comes with a cash prize and a pair of
commemorative Yubikeys! Huzzah!

We spent a lot of time getting Yubikey support in OpenKeychain to work, and
although we didn't quite achieve feature completeness during the time of the
hackathon, we are quite happy with our progress and will be sure to take
this project to completion!

The other two winners are the [MFAStack](http://www.mfastack.com/) and [CSIS
Enrollment Station](https://github.com/CSIS/EnrollmentStation) projects.
Congratulations, guys!


Thanks to Yubico for supporting community efforts like this!
