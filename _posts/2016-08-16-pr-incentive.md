Every now and then we receive pull requests from contributors which fix bugs, make improvements or even add a new feature to OpenKeychain.
This is what open source is all about, and it's what keeps us going.
So we decided that we want to reward those awesome people who spend their time and effort making OpenKeychain the best app it can be.  

Starting today, as a token reward we will send a free [Fidesmo card](http://shop.fidesmo.com/product/fidesmo-privacy) with the OpenPGP applet preinstalled to new contributors!
Just submit a (non-trivial) pull request, you are eligible once we merge it.
To keep the bureaucratic overhead to a minimum, we will simply ask for an address to send the card to after we merge, and the card will be sent directly from our friends over at [Fidesmo](https://www.fidesmo.com/).
